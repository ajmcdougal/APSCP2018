    <p>I'm Addison McDougal, and I am a student at eAchieve taking AP Computer Science Principals. 
    I've been interested in computers and programming for as long as I can remember. 
    However, what really started me was when my mother reccomended a program called "Scratch" to me when I was around 10 years old. 
    I downloaded Scratch onto my Linux laptop and started to toy around with it. 
    I created a few simple games and some small animated films with it. 
    Once I started going to eAchieve for high school, I immediately gravitated toward the Web Design class taught by Mr. Hardt. 
    I found that I wanted to sink my hands into the code itself, not mess around with an editor. 
    For My sophomore year, I signed up for Web Development A and B. 
    I loved those classes, I learned a ton about programming and found something that I was pretty good at. 
    My Junior year I didn't have all that much in terms of computer science courses, which was mainly due to already having six classes to deal with and a new AP one on top of that. 
    Now this year I had a free spot and I immediately filled it with this class, which drew be both because of the computer science and the fact that it's an AP course. 
    I can't wait to get started!</p>
