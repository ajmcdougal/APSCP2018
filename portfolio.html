        <p>There comes a time when a man has to describe his scratch project and share a picture of it.<br><br>
        This project is a virtual piano that allows both clicking on the keys and using your keyboard. 
        Using signals in the code allows keys to be pressed rapidly with no delay before you can press it again. 
        There's also some music I made (with credit to Music Sheet Boss, whose videos I used as a guide.)</p>
